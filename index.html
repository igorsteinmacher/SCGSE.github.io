        <p>Collaboration is a fundamental problem of global software engineering. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in software support for collaborative software engineering, including researchers interested in global collaborations. The intent is to involve a wide range of researchers including those who develop software tool support, perform modeling, or perform empirical (quantitative or qualitative) studies of collaborative and global software engineering. Aside from the typical position papers and discussions, we intend to develop a summary document (aka “white paper”) outlining achievements to date and compiling challenges for the automated engineering community.</p>

<p>Automated software engineering, and software engineering in general, has a rich history around the issues of collaboration. One might argue that many of the tools, models, and studies that have been reported in the ASE conference series have in one way or another had to do with collaboration. This workshop seeks specifically to highlight collaboration as a specific lens or framework for assessing the state of the art in automated support for collaborative and global software engineering. In taking this focus, issues about integrative solutions, open problems, and a research agenda will emerge. </p>

<p>Themes of workshop include but are not limited to the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>Models of collaboration, including specific aspects such as awareness, trust, or coordination;</li>
<li>Empirical studies, both qualitative and quantitative, including ethnographic studies, surveys, and case studies;</li>
<li>Software tool support for collaboration, including analytics, user interface issues, and cognitive support;</li>
<li>Issues of context, e.g. radically co-located and globally distributed collaborations, and degrees in-between;</li>
<li>Social and organizational issues, including trust, privacy, and incentives.</li>
  <li>More themes</li>  
</ul>
